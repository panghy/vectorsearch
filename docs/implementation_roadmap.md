## üìê **Key Implementation Decisions Made**

### **Storage Architecture**
- **Block Size**: 256-512 codes per block (~24-64KB) for optimal FDB performance
- **Compression**: Float16 for codebooks, uint8 for PQ codes
- **Caching**: LRU caches with configurable size limits
- **Transactions**: Small, conflict-resilient writes (<10MB affected data)

### **PQ Configuration** 
- **Default nbits**: 8 (Milvus-compatible)
- **Default subvectors**: D/2 if not specified
- **Codebook size**: 256 codewords (2^8)
- **Distance metrics**: L2, IP, COSINE supported

### **Test Coverage Standards**
- **Instruction coverage**: 91% achieved (target: >90%) ‚úÖ
- **Line coverage**: 90% achieved (meets 90% target) ‚úÖ
- **Branch coverage**: 81% achieved (exceeds 75% target) ‚úÖ
- **Integration**: Real FDB connections, no mocks per project standards
- **Patterns**: Follow existing test structure
- **Large-scale tests**: FdbVectorSearchIntegrationTest with 500+ vectors

### **Recent Implementation Patterns**
- **Maintenance Methods**: Made package-private for better testability while keeping public APIs clean
- **Async Maintenance**: All maintenance operations return `CompletableFuture<Void>` for proper testing
- **Cache Testing**: Added `getPqBlockCache()` accessor for testing cache behavior and eviction
- **Background Services**: Integrated scheduled maintenance tasks for entry point refresh and connectivity repair
- **Test Isolation**: Each test uses unique collections to avoid interference

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Integration Gaps**

### Recently Completed (Dec 2024):
1. ‚úÖ **BeamSearchEngine** - Now fully wired to FdbVectorSearch.search() methods
2. ‚úÖ **ProductQuantizer** - Properly initialized with codebooks loaded on demand
3. ‚úÖ **Integration Testing** - Comprehensive tests with 500+ vectors, clustering, and search validation

### Components Built But Not Fully Utilized:
1. **VectorSketchStorage** - Storing sketches but no codebook retraining implementation uses them
2. **Statistics Collection** - getStats() returns hardcoded zeros, no actual metrics gathering

### Missing Components:
1. **UnlinkWorker** - Does not exist, delete operations enqueue tasks with no processor
2. **Codebook Training** - No initial codebook generation from training data
3. **Codebook Rotation** - Two-phase rotation not implemented
4. **Vector Count** - getVectorCount() returns 0, not implemented

## üéØ **Next Milestone: Complete Core Functionality**

**Priority 1 - Critical (System Functional):**
1. **Implement Codebook Training** - Generate initial codebooks from training data
2. **Create UnlinkWorker** - Process delete operations
3. **Wire LinkWorker** - Actually process link tasks from queue

**Priority 2 - Enhanced Functionality:**
1. **Implement getStats()** - Gather actual metrics
2. **Implement getVectorCount()** - Track actual vector count
3. **Codebook retraining** - Use stored vector sketches for periodic updates

**Success Criteria:**
- System can train initial codebooks from inserted vectors
- Delete operations are processed by UnlinkWorker
- LinkWorker processes tasks to build graph connections
- Search returns actual results (not empty) after indexing

*This roadmap will be updated as implementation progresses. Current focus: **Codebook training to enable actual search results.***
