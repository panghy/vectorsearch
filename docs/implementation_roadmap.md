# FDB-backed Vector Search Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the implementation progress of the FDB-backed PQ + DiskANN vector search system described in `original_ideation.md`.

## üéØ Project Overview

Building a millisecond-latency Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search system using:
- **FoundationDB** as the distributed key-value store
- **Product Quantization (PQ)** for vector compression and fast distance computation
- **DiskANN-style graph traversal** for high-recall search
- **Transactional queue system** for online upsert/delete operations

## üìê **Key Implementation Decisions Made**

### **Storage Architecture**
- **Block Size**: 256-512 codes per block (~24-64KB) for optimal FDB performance
- **Compression**: Float16 for codebooks, uint8 for PQ codes
- **Caching**: LRU caches with configurable size limits
- **Transactions**: Small, conflict-resilient writes (<10MB affected data)

### **PQ Configuration** 
- **Default nbits**: 8 (Milvus-compatible)
- **Default subvectors**: D/2 if not specified
- **Codebook size**: 256 codewords (2^8)
- **Distance metrics**: L2, IP, COSINE supported

### **Test Coverage Standards**
- **Line coverage**: 91% achieved (target: >90%)
- **Branch coverage**: 82% achieved (target: >75%) 
- **Integration**: Real FDB connections, no mocks
- **Patterns**: Follow existing test structure
