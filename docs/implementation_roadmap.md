## üìê **Key Implementation Decisions Made**

### **Storage Architecture**
- **Block Size**: 256-512 codes per block (~24-64KB) for optimal FDB performance
- **Compression**: Float16 for codebooks, uint8 for PQ codes
- **Caching**: LRU caches with configurable size limits
- **Transactions**: Small, conflict-resilient writes (<10MB affected data)

### **PQ Configuration** 
- **Default nbits**: 8 (Milvus-compatible)
- **Default subvectors**: D/2 if not specified
- **Codebook size**: 256 codewords (2^8)
- **Distance metrics**: L2, IP, COSINE supported

### **Test Coverage Standards**
- **Instruction coverage**: 91% achieved (target: >90%) ‚úÖ
- **Line coverage**: 90% achieved (meets 90% target) ‚úÖ
- **Branch coverage**: 81% achieved (exceeds 75% target) ‚úÖ
- **Integration**: Real FDB connections, no mocks per project standards
- **Patterns**: Follow existing test structure
- **Large-scale tests**: FdbVectorSearchIntegrationTest with 500+ vectors

### **Recent Implementation Patterns**
- **Maintenance Methods**: Made package-private for better testability while keeping public APIs clean
- **Async Maintenance**: All maintenance operations return `CompletableFuture<Void>` for proper testing
- **Cache Testing**: Added `getPqBlockCache()` accessor for testing cache behavior and eviction
- **Background Services**: Integrated scheduled maintenance tasks for entry point refresh and connectivity repair
- **Test Isolation**: Each test uses unique collections to avoid interference

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Integration Gaps**

### Components Built But Not Fully Utilized:
1. **VectorSketchStorage** - Storing sketches but no codebook retraining implementation uses them
2. **Statistics Collection** - getStats() returns hardcoded zeros, no actual metrics gathering

### Missing Components:
1. **UnlinkWorker** - Does not exist, delete operations enqueue tasks with no processor
2. **Codebook Rotation** - Two-phase rotation not implemented
3. **Vector Count** - getVectorCount() returns 0, not implemented

## üéØ **Next Milestone: Accuracy Improvement (DiskANN-style)**

**Priority 1 - Accuracy Improvement (DiskANN-style):**
1. **Store Original Vectors** - Store full-precision vectors alongside graph for exact distance computation
   - Consider float16 compression for storage efficiency
2. **Implement Reranking Pipeline** - Use PQ for candidate selection, original vectors for final ranking
   - Overquery strategy: Fetch 3x candidates using PQ distance, rerank with original vectors
   - Two-stage process: PQ for graph traversal, original vectors for top-k results
3. **Hybrid Distance Computation** - PQ distances for graph traversal, exact distances for results
   - BeamSearchEngine continues using PQ for navigation
   - Load original vectors only for final candidate set
   - Return exact distances to users (fixing the ~6-7 distance for exact matches issue)

**Priority 2 - Critical (System Functional):**
1. **Create UnlinkWorker** - Process delete operations (or handle via compaction)
2. **Implement getStats()** - Gather actual metrics  
3. **Implement getVectorCount()** - Track actual vector count

**Success Criteria for Original Vector Storage:**
- Original vector storage enables exact distance computation (distance ~0 for exact matches)
- Reranking with original vectors improves accuracy to >90% on random data
- System maintains high performance with hybrid PQ/original vector approach
- Search returns actual results with accurate distances
