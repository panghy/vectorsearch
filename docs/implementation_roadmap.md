# FDB-backed Vector Search Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the implementation progress of the FDB-backed PQ + DiskANN vector search system described in `original_ideation.md`.

## üéØ Project Overview

Building a millisecond-latency Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search system using:
- **FoundationDB** as the distributed key-value store
- **Product Quantization (PQ)** for vector compression and fast distance computation

## üìê **Key Implementation Decisions Made**

### **Storage Architecture**
- **Block Size**: 256-512 codes per block (~24-64KB) for optimal FDB performance
- **Compression**: Float16 for codebooks, uint8 for PQ codes
- **Caching**: LRU caches with configurable size limits
- **Transactions**: Small, conflict-resilient writes (<10MB affected data)

### **PQ Configuration** 
- **Default nbits**: 8 (Milvus-compatible)
- **Default subvectors**: D/2 if not specified
- **Codebook size**: 256 codewords (2^8)
- **Distance metrics**: L2, IP, COSINE supported

### **Test Coverage Standards**
- **Instruction coverage**: 91% achieved (target: >90%)
- **Line coverage**: 93% achieved (exceeds 90% target)
- **Branch coverage**: 81% achieved (exceeds 75% target) 
- **Integration**: Real FDB connections, no mocks per project standards
- **Patterns**: Follow existing test structure

### **Recent Implementation Patterns**
- **Maintenance Methods**: Made package-private for better testability while keeping public APIs clean
- **Async Maintenance**: All maintenance operations return `CompletableFuture<Void>` for proper testing
- **Cache Testing**: Added `getPqBlockCache()` accessor for testing cache behavior and eviction
- **Background Services**: Integrated scheduled maintenance tasks for entry point refresh and connectivity repair
- **Test Isolation**: Each test uses unique collections to avoid interference

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Integration Gaps**

### Components Built But Not Connected:
1. **BeamSearchEngine** - Fully implemented search engine returning empty results (search() in FdbVectorSearch has TODO)
2. **ProductQuantizer** - Not initialized from codebook storage (line 426-428 TODO)
3. **VectorSketchStorage** - Storing sketches but no codebook retraining implementation uses them
4. **Statistics Collection** - getStats() returns hardcoded zeros, no actual metrics gathering

### Missing Components:
1. **UnlinkWorker** - Does not exist, delete operations enqueue tasks with no processor
2. **Codebook Rotation** - Two-phase rotation not implemented
3. **Vector Count** - getVectorCount() returns 0, not implemented

## üéØ **Next Milestone: Wire Up Existing Components**

**Priority 1 - Critical (System Non-Functional):**
1. **Wire BeamSearchEngine to search()** - Make search actually work
2. **Create UnlinkWorker** - Process delete operations
3. **Initialize ProductQuantizer** - Load from codebook storage on startup

**Priority 2 - Enhanced Functionality:**
4. **Implement getStats()** - Gather actual metrics
5. **Implement getVectorCount()** - Track actual vector count
6. **Codebook retraining** - Use stored vector sketches

**Success Criteria:**
- Search returns actual results using BeamSearchEngine
- Delete operations are processed by UnlinkWorker
- ProductQuantizer properly initialized from stored codebooks
- Statistics reflect actual system state
